Functionality
-------------
Structure:
Tree? Acyclic digraph?

Atomic truth:
conclusion and premise both are statements
subconclusion can be treated the same way as a premise

Grouping:
joint vs. independent support
a joint support group functions as a single atomic truth value

Validate against:
Cyclic dependency
Unused premises

Truth propagation:
Take certain premises to be true or false
Show resultant truth value for conclusions and subconclusions


Representations
---------------
XML:
Conclusion and joint group tags enclose premises
Represent tree structure through nesting

JSON or other bracket-y system:
Alternate way of representing tree structure with nesting

CFG:
Define premises
Define "requires" relationships
Represent tree structure though child node list
